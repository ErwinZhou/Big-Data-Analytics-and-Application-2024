# PageRank
## Introduction
PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. It is a way of measuring the importance of website pages.
We implemented  the basic PageRank algorithmn to compute the scores based on a given Dataset(Data.txt).
Based that, we optimize the robustness and efficiency of our algorithmn by the following works:
* Considering the case of dead ends and spider traps.
* Using the power iteration method to compute the PageRank scores.
* Optimizing on sparse matrix.
* Deployment the Block-Strip Update Algorithmn.
